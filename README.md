# Accounting

This accounting script has helped the Accounting Department save a lot of time. In the normal manner, the accounting team was
supposed manually compare information from the bank statements with the information from our system every single day, 
both for Avis and Budget brands. The script searches for files received from the central server located in Bracknell/UK. If both
files (for Avis and Budget) were received, then starts parsing the text within, else it postpones for the next day.
